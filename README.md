# Fabric-Defect-Detection
A computer based automatic fabric defect detection system that detects edges using Canny algorithm via Digital Image Processing in open source Computer Vision integrated with Raspberry pi to execute the model.


The defects occurring in the fabric is a result of flaw in manufacturing process as
well as the fabric inspection process. So, fabric inspection process or we can say
fabric defect detection is very important for the textile industry, so that the
product received by the customer is defect free. In the recent year of technological
advancement automatic fabric defect detection is developed and it has sidelined
the traditional process which is performed by humans. Generally, the automatic
defect detection process involves three steps: image acquisition, defect detection
and post processing of fabric.
